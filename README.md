# How to Write a README

["How to Write a README"](HowToReadMe.md) is a guide that documents the most common conventions used in README files. This file is not the guide itself, but the README for the project which contains the guide. Several guides exist, but none of them are comprehensive, and one of them link to examples of each suggestion.

## Contributions

The guide is very much a work in progress. Contributions are welcome and appreciated.

There are a number of areas that need contribution:

* Broken links
* Incorrect links
* Misspellings
* Grammar mistakes
* Stubs/incomplete sections

When linking to a README, whenever possible, try to link to a specific revision of the README.
